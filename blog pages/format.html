    <p>Something ive noticed from last year with pretty much anything that is trying to run as what i would call an enabler in web tech is they sort of are always business/subscription minded somehow

The image above has node, bun and deno

They're basically runtimes for js

To deploy any of them you'd need a server with story basically

However deno here from what i recall has its own deployment service which is subscription based
It will still run on regular servers (i think) but it makes it braindead easy to deploy. 
Theyre not the first ones to do this though
But ive been seeing too many companies start this

Vercel brought NextJS, but as its serverless the only way to use it is basically with vercels platform (technically) which is fine. But that just guarantees vercel money at some point when you need to scale (big brein strat)

A couple of other services ive been trying out too have started this

Strapi which is a cms is building their own cloud deployment platform, Payload CMS is also doing the same.

Astro which i mentioned that ive been playing with is basically netlifys home (technically cos they're sponsoring the project)

There's planetscale too
Which is a database service (very good service btw)

I really dont have any issues with this personally as i dont pay to use any of these for now but i am concerned with how many keep popping up


I mean last year Heroku killed the free tier(which sucks ass cos now to do anything with node you have to pay, doesn't matter what platform)

Im now imagining if most of these platforms who make services that are somewhat locked to their platform goes
_"no more free shit fellas"_

It unlikely...

But then heroku started it

I just find this a bit perplexing
And its even funnier when you realize most of them run on AWSðŸ¥±.

Ah well, this had been in my head for too long

Lemme know if you read this to the end by answering if youve watched the new puss in boots movie.
I should get a blog to organize these thoughts ffs</p>
