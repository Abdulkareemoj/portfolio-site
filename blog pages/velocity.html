     <div> <h1 class="heading2">Hey There</h1>
      <div>
      <p>As developers we all struggle with one thing or another when coding or programming something, and thats normal we
        always learn from that experience. What most people do is search up tutorial video and see if the problem they have
        has been experienced by anyone else(i know ive done it, a lot). Its actually a good way to learn but if you do it
        too much you end up looking at tutorials more often than you should and before you realise it youre in
        tutorial hell.</p></div>

    <div> <h1 class="heading2">What is Tutorial Hell?</h1></div> 
    <div>  <img class="vimg" src="/Responsive Portfolio Website/images/doomguycourse.jpg" alt="doomguycourse" ></div>
  <div>  <p>
        What is ‘Tutorial hell’?
        As you start learning to code, It may feel like, youre learning a lot and one you decide to build something on your
        own. You have your cmputer, your tools and your editor in front of you, but you can tseem to do anything . You
        start another course and then the same happens and again for another course an over and over, this right here is
        Tutorial hell.
        " 'Tutorial hell' is typically the stage when beginner programmers come to 'sort of' knowing how to build some
        simple things, but nothing really complex or scalable. They seem to need a tutorial for every other task they are
        in need of doing. "
        Urban Dictionary
        When you continuously watch tutorials one after another and you feel like, you are learning a lot of things and
        building some good projects. As soon as you start doing something on your own, you get to know that you don’t know
        anything. sounds ludicrous right? You have built some good and large projects and still, you don’t know anything,
        how is it even possible? This is what happens when you are in tutorial hell, you think you are learning, you are
        accomplishing something, but what you are actually doing is depending on tutorials to teach you to solve the only
        problem which you have watched. It stops you from learning how to solve problems.
        "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."
        Albert Einstein

<div><h2 class="heading2">Alternatives to Tutorials </h1></div>
<div><p>Documentation</p></div>
<div><p>The programming language Documentation should be your next best friend while coding. Sites like MDN, W3Schools have
  possibly everything you need explained out for you and with that you wont always be following what some one did in a
  video tutorial </p></div>


  <p> But what if you're someone who works witha a lot of languages? Well there's also alternative for that case
What if i told you there was a way to get all the documentation for all the languages you use in one app offline</p>


<div><h3>Say hello to Velocity</h3></div>
<div><img class="vimg" src="/Responsive Portfolio Website/images/Velocity.gif" alt="velocity documentation"></div>
<div><p>It gives you access to download a Huge Documentation Library with over 150+ API documentation sets covering some of
  the most popular languages and API
  frameworks that you use for everyday development. Unfortunateley it only works for windows</p></div>
<div><p>Fear not however</p></div>
<div><img class="vimg" src="/Responsive Portfolio Website/images/dashpage.jpg" alt="dash"></div>
<div><p>MacOS has its own documentation library called dash. Its essentially Velocity for MacOS but both apps are made by
  different developers. The very same docsets you use in Dash are available with Velocity too.</p></div>
